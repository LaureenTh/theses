# Guideline for the Use of Digital Tools

The integration of digital tools, including Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, grammar checkers, and reference managers, is increasingly common in academic research and writing. To uphold intellectual honesty and academic ethics, students should transparently acknowledge the use of these tools in their theses.

Usage and Acknowledgement

**1. Transparent Disclosure**
 - Include a section titled "Digital Tools Used" after the conclusion of your thesis.
 - Mention all digital tools utilized, such as grammar checkers, reference managers, and LLMs like ChatGPT. Specify the type of assistance each tool provided.
 - For LLMs/ChatGPT, detail the specific nature of their assistance (e.g., idea generation, language suggestions).

**2. Validation of Information**
 - Cross-verify any information or data provided by digital tools with credible academic sources.
 - The responsibility for factual accuracy and data integrity remains with the thesis author(s), despite the use of these tools.

**3. Distinguishing Intellectual Contribution**
 - Clearly differentiate between your original contributions and those supplemented by digital tools.
 - Use digital tools as aids to enhance your work, not as replacements for your intellectual effort.

**4. Adherence to Ethical Standards**
 - Comply with your institutionâ€™s policies regarding the use of digital tools in academic research.
 - Ensure your usage of these tools does not infringe upon academic integrity principles.

**5. Citing Digital Tools**
 - When appropriate, cite the use of digital tools. For instance, reference LLMs/ChatGPT as: "Assisted by ChatGPT, an AI language model by OpenAI (year)."
 - Include similar citations for other digital tools as needed.

**6. Responsibility for Final Content**
 - Acknowledge that you, as the author, bear full responsibility for the content of your thesis.
 - Ensure the use of digital tools does not compromise the originality and academic rigor of your work.

The thoughtful and ethical use of digital tools, including LLMs like ChatGPT, in academic writing is essential. By adhering to these guidelines, students can leverage these tools effectively while maintaining the credibility and integrity required in academic scholarship.
