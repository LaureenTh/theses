# Pre-submission checklist

Before submitting the thesis, it may be useful to check the following items:

- For (regression) models, the model formulas are provided.
- Every figure and table is referenced and described in the text.
- Choose appropriate formatting of numbers that does not suggest unjustified levels of accuracy (e.g., response times of employees in ms).
- If feasible, arrange rows/columns/bars in an order of numerical progression; always indicate what numbers are shown, including units (axes, legends).
- Provide complete reference information in the reference section (e.g., including Authors, Title, Journal, Volume, Issue).
- Keep in mind that claims of significance require appropriate statistical tests.
- The writing style should be objective and neutral, in particular in the related work, methodology, and results sections. Clearly indicate when you go beyond the data and develop your own interpretation (e.g., in the form of propositions).
- References: all papers cited in the text are in the reference section, and all papers in the reference section are cited in the text
- The declaration at the end is identical with the declaration shared by the examination office.

Note: this list is not complete. Please feel free to suggest additional items.
